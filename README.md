# tripal_domain
Protein domain search

This module provides a search and display page for interproscan-derived protein domain annotations

Pre-requisites of this module:
-load protein domain features data from parsed iprscan GFF files into chado
-load Interpro Ontology from interpro website (we have used ver 46.0 for our site)

About this module:
This interface displays users the listing of protein domains like PFAM, PANTHER,SMART,TIGRFAM,SMART etc and their alignment information to polypeptides. They are obtained by running InterProScan Analysis on polypeptides
Also, user is provided with the count of genes and the gene family that are assoiciated with each domain per species.
